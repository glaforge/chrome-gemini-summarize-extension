# Gemini Page Summarizer Chrome Extension

This is a custom Chrome extension that uses the Google Gemini API to summarize the content of web pages. It provides a quick and easy way to get the key points from articles, blog posts, and other text-heavy pages directly in your browser.

## Features

- **Smart Content Extraction**: Automatically finds and summarizes the main article content on a page, ignoring sidebars, ads, and other clutter.
- **Selected Text Summarization**: If you highlight a specific portion of text on a page, the extension will summarize only your selection.
- **Streaming Summaries**: The summary appears word-by-word in real-time as it's being generated by the AI model.
- **Shrink Functionality**: Further condense an already generated summary to make it even more concise.
- **Bilingual Support**: Generate summaries in either English or French with a convenient toggle.
- **Rich Text Copy**: Copy the formatted summary (including bolding, bullet points, etc.) to your clipboard.
- **Polished UI**: A clean and intuitive interface with helpful tooltips and a dedicated setup screen for new users.
